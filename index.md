---
Welcome to the website of the benchmarking data archives of the [COCO](https://github.com/numbbo/coco) (Comparing Continuous Optimizers) platform. 

Besides providing the official archives from numerical benchmarking experiments, run on the COCO platform, and that are available through its cocopp python module, this website also provides lists of those official data sets with additional information like authors, links to papers, source code etc. Right now, data sets for the following test suites are available:

* [bbob]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link bbob.md %}): 24 single-objective noiseless functions
* [bbob-noisy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link bbob-noisy.md %}): 24 single-objective noisy functions
* [bbob-biobj]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link bbob-biobj.md %}): 55 bi-objective functions
* [bbob-largescale]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link bbob-largescale.md %}): large-scale version of the 24 bbob functions (dimension up to 640)
* [bbob-mixint]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link bbob-mixint.md %}): mixed-integer versions of the 24 bbob functions
